# Game Grumps Bingo

A fun weekend project I started when the streamer Bingo card trend took off. The site is a simple HTML/CSS/JS single page app. No IDE is required, but I later switched to Visual Studio (hence, the .sln file) simply because I like the editor better than Notepad++ after a certain project size.

The project also served as a great way to practice converting to other frameworks like Angular because it has interactivity, state, and form elements.
